Game data collected for this experiment comes from Wikipedia's articles on the lists of [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games#Licensed_games) and [SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System_games#List) video games.
Their HTML tables were converted into CSV files, after which Genre and Price columns were added manually, based on my (Charlie's) judgement.
